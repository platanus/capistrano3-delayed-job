# Capistrano::DelayedJob [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/capistrano3-delayed-job.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/capistrano3-delayed-job)

Delayed Job support for Capistrano 3.x

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'capistrano3-delayed-job', '~> 1.0'
    gem 'capistrano'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install capistrano3-delayed-job

## Usage

Require in `Capfile` to use the default task:

```ruby
require 'capistrano/delayed-job'
```

You will get the following tasks

```ruby
cap delayed_job:start                    # Start delayed_job service
cap delayed_job:stop                     # Stop delayed_job service
cap delayed_job:reload                   # Reload delayed_job service
```

Configurable options (copy into deploy.rb), shown here with examples:

```ruby
# Number of delayed_job workers
# default value: 1
set :delayed_job_workers, 2

# String to be prefixed to worker process names
# This feature allows a prefix name to be placed in front of the process.
# For example:  reports/delayed_job.0  instead of just delayed_job.0
set :delayed_job_prefix, :reports               


# Delayed_job queue or queues
# Set the --queue or --queues option to work from a particular queue.
# default value: nil
set :delayed_job_queues, ['mailer','tracking']

# Specify different pools
# You can use this option multiple times to start different numbers of workers for different queues.
# default value: nil
set :delayed_job_pools, {
    :mailer => 2,
    :tracking => 1,
    :* => 2
}

# Set the roles where the delayed_job process should be started
# default value: :app
set :delayed_job_roles, [:app, :background]

# Set the location of the delayed_job executable
# Can be relative to the release_path or absolute
# default value 'bin'
set :delayed_job_bin_path, 'script' # for rails 3.x
```

It also adds the following hook

```ruby
after 'deploy:publishing', 'restart' do
    invoke 'delayed_job:restart'
end
```
